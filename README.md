# Project Title

OSPO Diversity: Open-source Projects Contributors Affiliation 

## Background

Red Hat is an active leader in open source projects and Red Hat is also involved in maintaining a healthy open source community. The health and sustainability of an open source community is co-determined by a lot of factors, as CHAOSS project metrics displays. Diversity of community contributors within projects is pertinent to Red Hat’s business as well as open-source projects that are beneficial to the ecosystem. 
Usually, the level of participation of each company’s employees (especially Redhatters) in open-source projects can be issued by the email domain of participants. However, Red Hat employees are not required to use “redhat.com” email domain when they’re contributing to projects so not every contributor uses their work email in project participation. Also, Redhatters may have moved between companies during time. 
Therefore, it’s desirable to improve the ability to determine and classify contributors’ identity and affiliated organization with machine learning methods. 

## Project Goals

The project consists of building a better identification of the following aspects:
* Is the contributor a full-time employee or a volunteer
* Is the contributor a Redhatter or a non-Redhatter
* What’s the contributor’s affiliated company if he/she is a non-Redhatter
